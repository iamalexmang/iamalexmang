# Hi, I'm Alex 👋🏻🧑🏼‍💻
#### (he/him)

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about technology, constantly thriving to make code which inspires people. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **.NET**, **Microsoft Azure** and **AI**. In 2016, I became a member of the **Microsoft MVP** community and was later also selected as a **Microsoft Regional Director**. 
My interest in Azure led me to launch **Cloudees Lounge**, a community for cloud enthusiast.
