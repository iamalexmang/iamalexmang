# Hi, I'm Alex 👋🏻🧑🏼‍💻
#### (he/him)

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about technology, constantly thriving to make code which inspires people. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **.NET**, **Microsoft Azure** and **AI**. 

In 2016, I became a member of the [**Microsoft MVP**](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/91425367-aea0-e511-8114-c4346bac0abc) community and was later also selected as a [**Microsoft Regional Director**](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/RD/profile/91425367-aea0-e511-8114-c4346bac0abc). 
My interest in Azure led me to launch [**Cloudee Lounge**](https://www.meetup.com/cloudeelounge/), a community for cloud enthusiast.
